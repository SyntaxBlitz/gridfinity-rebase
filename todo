- try harder to find a progress bar
  - man i did try harder but even openscad-playground doesn't have one
- maybe avoid saving gold if too big? not a huge deal since it's async now
- abort scad on reupload (or just disable reupload?)
- garbage collect openscad so we don't oom
  (or, i dunno, reuse it?)
- prefabs
  --> maybe even with parameters

  - but this isn't super high-priority. i think most users have one preference, and it'll stick in their localstorage. this isn't really an 'exploratory' tool where you get to look at all the options. wrong ui for that anyway.

#2 warn on badness

- find a better way to keep the openscad instance in memory if possible instead of making a new one each time

- could render numbers a bit better when rotated 90
  - maybe those little circle triangle pointer guys?
- refactors, cleanups (make app.tsx small)
