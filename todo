- STL preview of the final result?
- automatically start processing asap
- try harder to find a progress bar
- automatically find a grid in gold
  - warn if multiple
  - even the rotation would be reasonable
- maybe avoid saving gold if too big? not a huge deal since it's async now
  \*- show the identified bases
- abort scad on reupload (or just disable reupload?)
- garbage collect openscad so we don't oom
  (or, i dunno, reuse it?)
- prefabs
