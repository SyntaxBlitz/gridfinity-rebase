- STL preview of the final result?
- automatically start processing asap
- try harder to find a progress bar
- automatically find a grid in gold
  - warn if multiple
  - even the rotation would be reasonable
- maybe avoid saving gold if too big? not a huge deal since it's async now
- show the identified bases
